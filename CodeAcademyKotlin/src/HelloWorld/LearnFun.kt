package HelloWorld

//fun is a Kotlin keyword that is used to declare a function.
//main is the required name of the starting function.
//Following the function name is a pair of empty parentheses ().
//Code that is written inside the curly brackets ({ }) is considered the “body” of a function. When we hit Enter
// to create a new line of code inside the body, the code will automatically indent itself:

fun main() {
    println("Coding is fun!")
}
